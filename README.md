# Exercise Web Server in C

From my Computer Systems class. Runs in UIC CS Systems VM.

*Note:* Custom 400 and 404 page found in WWW directory
400 and 404 does not work sadly if argv[2] is not WWW

Semi-working directory page.
Jumping to directories work but does not open files in right directory nor does it open main.

Threading is not included (I think, unless it miraculously works)...

Compile with ./homework6 [PORTNO] WWW

DO NOT COPY FOR HOMEWORK PURPOSES! Absolutely not responsible for bad grades and you not learning either. :(
